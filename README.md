Contribute to the wiki page

To contribute, create a Pull Request. Each pull request will be reviewed before being accepted.

- **Main categories** = top-level folders.
- **Categories** = subfolders inside main categories.
- **Pages** = Markdown files inside categories.

## Page Format

Each page should start with a `TITLE:` line and a `CONTENT:` marker:

```markdown
TITLE:Example title
CONTENT:
# Example header
- Example item
```

The TITLE: is used for the browser tab title.

Everything after CONTENT: is rendered as the wiki page.
